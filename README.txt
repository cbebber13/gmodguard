
GModGuard is an addon for Garry's Mod, similar to Minecrafts MCBans, it allows admins from approved
communities to share their bans with other servers running GModGuard. To prevent abuse these bans are
not enforced on the other servers, however if a player joins your server with a history of bans from
other servers, online admins will be notified - they can then view details of the players previous
bans - the servers they're banned from and why. But that's as far as GModGuard will intrude, it's then 
completely up to you whether you ban the player or not.

For serious problem-players, there's also a global ban option - if you enable it, any player who has a 
global GModGuard ban will be unable to join your server. This will only be done in extreme cases, and 
will NOT be done for gamemode-specific rules. For a global ban to be issued, an individual request must
be made, along with valid supporting evidence. This will then be judged by a selected team of GModGuard
admins, who can then approve or disapprove the global ban.

We are also planning a fixed set of ban reasons for global bans - this list will contain what we feel are 
generic GMod rules that apply to the majority of servers, regardless of the gamemode they're running.
e.g. spamming with the intent to crash a server, prop blocking player spawn areas, mass prop killing,
threatening to DDoS servers/admins/players or using clientside hacks such as those we all know about.

The main issue with global ban databases like GModGuard is they can be abused, meaning players get a bad
reputation when they don't deserve one. To overcome this, we are going to limit who may use GModGuard on 
their servers. Participation will be application-based, so if you wish to add your community to GModGuard, 
you must submit information about it; Your Server IP, Website and Steam Group. We will then assess you and
your community to check that you and those you trust as admins are indeed trustworthy.

However, don't worry, anyone may download a limited version of GModGuard - in a "read-only" state. They 
will not be able to add bans to the database, however will be able to view information about players and the servers they've been banned from.
